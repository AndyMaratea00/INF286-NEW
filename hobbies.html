            <h3>Skateboarding</h3>
            <p class="lead">One of my favorite pastimes is skateboarding. I have skated on and off since the third grade, which is about 11 years. </p>
            <h3>Guitar</h3>
            <p class="lead">Another pastime/hobby of mine is guitar. I have played the guitar since sophomore year of high school. I took an entry level guitar class for one semester at my high school and stsrted with a 6 string. Fast forward a few years and I have taught myself so much since then and now play on a 7 string guitar.</p>
            <h3>Botting/Reselling</h3>
            <p class="lead">The most stressful but fun pastime I partake in is reselling shoes and clothes. I use a highly sought after automated checkout software called MEKaio to automatically purchase high-demand items. These items are usually clothes and shoes, but can be anything from Pok√©mon cards or makeup palettes to NVIDIA GPUs for computers. </p>
